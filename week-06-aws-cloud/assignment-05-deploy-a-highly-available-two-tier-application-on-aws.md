# Assignment 5 — Deploy a Highly Available Two-Tier Application on AWS (VPC + ALB + ASG + Multi-AZ RDS)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will design and deploy a highly available two-tier web application on AWS: highly available networking across two Availability Zones, an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling Group for the web tier, and a private Multi-AZ RDS database. You must prove high availability with real failure tests.

# Task 1 — Create HA Networking (VPC + 4 Subnets + IGW + NAT + Route Tables)

## Goal

Build a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with two public and two private subnets across two Availability Zones, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, and the matching public/private route tables.

### Evidence

# Task 2 — Create Security Groups (ALB, EC2, RDS) with Least Privilege

## Goal

Create `ha-alb-sg` (HTTP public), `ha-web-sg` (HTTP only from `ha-alb-sg`, SSH from your IP), and `ha-db-sg` (database port only from `ha-web-sg`).

### Evidence

# Task 3 — Deploy Database Tier (RDS Multi-AZ in Private Subnets)

## Goal

Launch a private, Multi-AZ RDS database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) using the private DB Subnet Group and `ha-db-sg`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — RDS summary showing Multi-AZ = Yes and Publicly accessible = No

---

# Task 4 — Build a Launch Template (User Data Installs App + Connects to DB)

## Goal

Create a Launch Template whose user data installs the web-server runtime, deploys the application, configures the database connection, and starts the required services.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Launch Template details showing that user data exists, including a visible snippet

![ha-web-lt](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/ha-web-lt.png)
![ha-web-lt](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/ha-web-lt-1.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — A running instance created from the template showing that the application responds on port 80 through a local test or browser using its public IP

![running-instance](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/instance-install.png)

---

# Task 5 — Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) Across 2 Public Subnets

## Goal

Create an internet-facing ALB across both public subnets with an HTTP listener and a healthy instance target group.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — ALB details showing two public subnets in two Availability Zones

![alb-details](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/ALB-Subnets.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Target group showing at least one healthy target

![healthy-targets](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/healthy-target.png)

---

# Task 6 — Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in 2 Public Subnets

## Goal

Create an Auto Scaling Group from the Launch Template across both public subnets, with desired capacity 2, minimum 2, and maximum 4, registered to the ALB target group.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 15 — Auto Scaling Group showing desired, minimum, and maximum capacity and the selected subnet Availability Zones

![asg-details](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/asg-details.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — EC2 instances list showing two running instances in different Availability Zones

![2-running-instances](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/ec2-running.png)

---

# Task 7 — Configure App to Use RDS + Validate Read/Write

## Goal

Confirm the application communicates with the RDS database through the ALB DNS name with at least one read and one write operation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 17 — Browser showing the application loaded through the ALB DNS name with the URL visible

![browser-app-show](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/ALB-Loaded.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Proof of a database write through a UI message or database query output

![proof-UI](/week-06-aws-cloud/screenshots/proof-ui-write.png)

---

# Task 8 — High Availability Tests (Must Do Both)

## Goal

Test A: terminate one web instance and confirm the Auto Scaling Group replaces it automatically without interrupting the ALB.

Test B: simulate an Availability Zone impact (stop, detach, or reduce desired capacity in one AZ) and confirm the application stays available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — EC2 showing the terminated instance and the newly launched instance; timestamps are helpful

# Task 9 — Architecture and Test-Results Summary

## Goal

Summarize the VPC/subnet layout, the ALB and Auto Scaling Group setup, the private Multi-AZ RDS setup, and the results of both high-availability tests.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 23 — A simple architecture diagram, which may be hand-drawn, or an AWS console overview showing the components

Infrastructure Summary
Network Setup: Built inside an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (ha-vpc) across a cloud region. Public traffic enters via an Internet Gateway and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that distributes requests across public subnets spanning multiple Availability Zones.

ALB / ASG Setup: An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) manages EC2 web instances running WordPress across public subnets, ensuring seamless scaling and traffic handling.

RDS Setup: A managed Amazon RDS database is deployed across private subnets to securely store application and user data, accepting database traffic exclusively from the web tier.

High-Availability Test Results
Test A (Instance Failure): When an active running EC2 instance is abruptly terminated, the Auto Scaling Group detects the failure within minutes and automatically provisions a brand-new replacement instance. Because the ALB continues routing traffic to the remaining healthy node, the WordPress site stays fully accessible with zero downtime.

Test B (Availability Zone / Instance Simulation): Simulating an outage or stopping an instance in a specific Availability Zone validates the high-availability failover design, ensuring traffic is safely routed and resilient across remaining healthy availability zones.
