# Assignment 3 — Automate React App Deployment Using Azure DevOps CI/CD

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will create a multi-stage Azure DevOps pipeline that builds, tests, publishes, and deploys a React application to an Ubuntu VM hosted on AWS or Azure. The pipeline will automatically run when changes are committed to `main`, transfer the production build as an artifact, and deploy it through Nginx.

---

# Task 0 — Verify the Starting Environment

## Goal

Confirm that Azure DevOps, the pipeline agent, Terraform, Ansible, and the selected cloud environment are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Import and Personalize the React Application

## Goal

Import the React application into Azure Repos and add your Full Name and the current date.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Imported React Project in Azure Repos

Add a screenshot of Azure Repos showing:

* Imported React project
* Repository name
* `main` branch
* Project files

# Task 2 — Provision and Configure the Target VM

## Goal

Provision an Ubuntu VM using Terraform and configure Nginx, React SPA routing, SSH access, and deployment permissions using Ansible.

No separate submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 3 — Create or Update the SSH Service Connection

## Goal

Create or update an Azure DevOps SSH Service Connection that allows the pipeline to connect securely to the target VM.

No separate submission screenshot is required for this task.

> Do not include the VM password, SSH private key, token, or another secret in the submission.

# Task 4 — Author the Multi-Stage Azure Pipeline

## Goal

Create an Azure Pipeline containing Build, Test, Publish, and Deploy stages with an automatic trigger for commits to `main`.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 2 — Multi-Stage Pipeline YAML

Add a screenshot of the Azure Pipeline YAML open in the editor showing:

* Trigger
* Build stage
* Test stage
* Publish stage
* Deploy stage

# Task 5 — Run the Pipeline and Resolve Configuration Issues

## Goal

Complete a successful end-to-end pipeline run containing all four stages.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Successful Multi-Stage Pipeline Run

Add a screenshot of one Azure DevOps pipeline run showing all four stages succeeded:

* Build
* Test
* Publish
* Deploy

# Task 6 — Verify the Deployment on the VM

## Goal

Confirm that the pipeline deployed the production-ready React files to the correct Nginx web root.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Post-Deployment Contents of /var/www/html

Add a screenshot of the pipeline SSH verification log or VM terminal showing the post-deployment contents of:

`/var/www/html`

# Task 7 — Verify the Website and Automatic Trigger

## Goal

Confirm that the React application is accessible and that a commit to `main` automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Deployed React Application

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Deployed React application
* VM public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Deployment date
