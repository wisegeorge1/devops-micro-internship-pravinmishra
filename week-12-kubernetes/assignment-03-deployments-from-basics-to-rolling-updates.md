# Task 5 — Scale the Deployment

## Goal

Scale the workload to five replicas and return it to two.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Scale-up command and output showing five Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Scale-down command and output showing the final two Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

# Task 6 — Share Your Kubernetes Deployment Progress on WhatsApp Status

## Goal

Share your Kubernetes Deployment learning progress on WhatsApp Status, including your generated DMI leaderboard progress link.

### Steps

1. Go to the DMI Leaderboard.
2. Find your name and select **Share your progress**.
3. Click the **WhatsApp icon**.
4. Copy the automatically generated leaderboard message containing your rank and progress link.
5. Open WhatsApp and go to **Updates**.
6. Create a new text Status.
7. Copy and paste the message below.
8. Insert the generated leaderboard message in the indicated place.
9. Review and publish your Status.

### WhatsApp Status Message

I practiced Kubernetes Deployments as part of my DevOps learning journey! 🚀

Today, I deployed NGINX, configured rolling updates, updated the container image, and rolled back to the previous version.

I also scaled my Deployment from two Pods to five and back to two!
