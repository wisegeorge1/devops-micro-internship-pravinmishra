# Assignment 1 — Creating Your First Pod in Kubernetes

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will create an NGINX Pod using both imperative and declarative methods. You will practice creating, checking, deleting, describing, viewing logs from, and opening a shell inside a Pod.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up Your Lab Folder

## Goal

Create a clean working directory for all Pod-related files used in this lab.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 01 — Output of `pwd` showing the current directory ending in `/k8s-labs/pods`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create a Pod Imperatively

## Goal

Create an NGINX Pod directly from the command line, verify that it is running, and delete it before continuing to the declarative method.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 02 — Output of `kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx` showing the creation message, and `kubectl get pods` showing `nginx-pod` with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`, before deletion

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 03 — Output of `kubectl delete pod nginx-pod` showing the successful deletion message

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create a Pod Declaratively Using YAML

## Goal

Define the NGINX Pod in a YAML file, apply the manifest, and verify the resulting Pod.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 04 — The filename `nginx-pod.yaml` and the complete YAML manifest with clear, readable indentation

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 05 — Output of `kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml` showing the successful creation message

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 06 — Output of `kubectl get pods` showing the declarative `nginx-pod` with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

**1. What is the difference between imperative and declarative Pod creation?**

Add your answer here.

# Task 4 — Inspect and Access the Pod

## Goal

Inspect the running Pod, view its logs, and open a shell inside the NGINX container.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 07 — Output of `kubectl describe pod nginx-pod` showing the Pod name, `app=nginx` label, `Running` status, container name, and NGINX image

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 08 — Output of `kFilename: `08-pod-logs.png`

Add your screenshot here.

If no logs appear, add a caption stating that the command completed without output.

---

#### Screenshot 09 — Container shell opened using `kubectl exec -it nginx-pod -- /bin/bash`, showing `cd /usr/share/nginx/html`, `pwd`, and `ls -la`, with the directory path and default NGINX files visible before exiting

Add your screenshot here.

### Task 5 — Share Your First Kubernetes Pod on WhatsApp Status

**Goal**

Share your Kubernetes learning progress on WhatsApp Status, including your generated DMI leaderboard progress link.

**Steps**

1. Go to the DMI Leaderboard.
2. Find your name and select **Share your progress**.
3. Click the **WhatsApp icon**.
4. Copy the automatically generated leaderboard message containing your rank and progress link.
5. Open WhatsApp and go to **Updates**.
6. Create a new text Status.
7. Copy and paste the message below.
8. Add the generated leaderboard message in the indicated place.
9. Review and publish your Status.

**WhatsApp Status Message**

I created my first Kubernetes Pod as part of my DevOps learning journey! 🚀

Today, I deployed an NGINX Pod using both imperative kubectl commands and a declarative YAML manifest.

I also checked its status, inspected its details, viewed its logs, and accessed the container shell.
