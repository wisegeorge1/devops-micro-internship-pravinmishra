# Assignment 02 — ReplicaSets: Keeping Your Pods Alive

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will create three NGINX Pods using a ReplicaSet, test auto-healing by deleting one Pod, and scale the ReplicaSet from three to five Pods.

---

# Task 0 — Pre-check: Remove the Pod from Assignment 01

## Goal

Confirm that you are connected to your learning cluster and remove the previous standalone Pod to prevent the ReplicaSet from adopting it.

### Evidence

No screenshots required.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up Your Working Directory

## Goal

Create and enter a dedicated directory for this ReplicaSet lab.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 01 — Output of `pwd` showing the working directory ending in `/k8s-labs/replicasets`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

**1. Why is it useful to keep Kubernetes manifests in organized directories?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. What file will you create in this directory for this assignment?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 2 — Create and Apply the NGINX ReplicaSet

## Goal

Create a ReplicaSet that maintains three NGINX Pods.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 02 — Completed `nginx-replicaset.yaml` manifest showing `replicas: 3`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 03 — Output of `kubectl apply -f nginx-replicaset.yaml`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 04 — Output of `kubectl get pods` showing three NGINX Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

**1. What does `replicas: 3` mean in this manifest?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. Why must `selector.matchLabels` match `template.metadata.labels`?**

Add your answer here.

---

**3. What image and image tag are used for the NGINX container?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 3 — Test ReplicaSet Auto-Healing

## Goal

Delete one Pod managed by the ReplicaSet and observe Kubernetes automatically create a replacement.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 05 — Output of the command deleting one ReplicaSet-managed Pod

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 06 — Output of `kubectl get pods` showing the replacement Pod with a different name from the deleted Pod

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 07 — Output showing three NGINX Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS` again

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

**1. What happened after you deleted one Pod?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. How does the ReplicaSet know that a replacement Pod is needed?**

Add your answer here.

---

**3. What proves that auto-healing worked successfully?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 4 — Manually Scale the ReplicaSet

## Goal

Scale the ReplicaSet from three NGINX Pods to five NGINX Pods by changing the YAML manifest.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 08 — Updated `nginx-replicaset.yaml` showing `replicas: 5`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 09 — Output of `kubectl get pods` showing five NGINX Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

**1. What change did you make to scale the ReplicaSet?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. Did you manually create the additional Pods? Explain why or why not.**

Add your answer here.

---

**3. What would happen if you changed the replica count from five back to three?**

Add your answer here.

# LinkedIn Requirement

Create a LinkedIn post that includes:

- A short explanation of what a Kubernetes ReplicaSet does.
- What happened when you deleted one NGINX Pod.

- What you learned by changing the replica count from three to five.
- One screenshot showing either:
  - Three Pods running after the auto-healing test, or
  - Five Pods running after scaling the ReplicaSet.

Do not share sensitive information, cluster credentials, tokens, or kubeconfig details in your post.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Published LinkedIn post showing your name, the required explanation, and the attached Pod screenshot

Add your screenshot here.
