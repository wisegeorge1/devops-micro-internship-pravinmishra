# Task 1 — Prepare the Kubernetes Cluster and Project

## Goal

Prepare the cluster, application source, container images, and tooling needed for the deployment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Active Kubernetes context and Ready nodes

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — If using Helm: Output of `helm version`

Required only if you choose Helm. Skip this screenshot if using YAML manifests.

Add your screenshot here, or write “Not applicable — using YAML manifests.”

---

# Task 2 — Design the Three-Tier Kubernetes Architecture

## Goal

Document the workloads, networking, configuration, storage, and permitted communication paths before deployment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Completed Kubernetes architecture diagram

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create ConfigMaps and Secrets

## Goal

Provide application configuration and credentials without embedding sensitive values in images or committing them to Git.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — ConfigMap configuration or describe output showing non-sensitive values

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Secret references or describe output showing names and keys without sensitive values

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Deploy and Configure the MySQL Data Tier

## Goal

Provide persistent MySQL storage and allow the backend to connect without exposing the database publicly.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Managed MySQL status or MySQL StatefulSet and PVC status

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Successful database connectivity or schema verification with credentials hidden

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Deploy the Backend Application Tier

## Goal

Run one or two Node.js/Express backend replicas on port 3001 and expose them through an internal ClusterIP Service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Backend Deployment, ready Pods, and internal Service

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Backend startup logs and database connectivity evidence

If the application does not log successful database connections, provide a successful database-backed request alongside the startup logs.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Deploy the Frontend and Configure Nginx

## Goal

Run the Next.js frontend behind Nginx on port 80 and proxy API requests to the internal backend Service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Frontend Deployment and Ready Pods

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Nginx reverse-proxy configuration showing the internal backend Service name and port 3001

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Configure External and Internal Networking

## Goal

Expose the frontend and enforce the intended communication path between application tiers.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — Frontend LoadBalancer or Ingress configuration and assigned endpoint, or documented local access method

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Internal backend Service and NetworkPolicy or equivalent restriction, with access-test evidence

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 8 — Validate the Application End to End

## Goal

Prove that the frontend, backend, and MySQL database work together and collect operational evidence.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 14 — `kubectl get all` output for the book-review namespace

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Functional Book Review App in the browser with the URL visible, including evidence of a successful user flow

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Frontend or Nginx container logs

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Backend logs and evidence of a successful database-backed operation

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Optional: Kubernetes dashboard

Add your screenshot here, or write “Not attempted.”

Multiple images may be included under a screenshot number when needed to demonstrate the complete user flow.

---

# Task 9 — Optional: Implement Production Improvements

## Goal

Add selected improvements without breaking the required three-tier architecture.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — Optional: Evidence of selected Helm, HPA, probe, or TLS improvements

Add your screenshot here, or write “Not attempted.”

---

# Task 10 — Publish Your Book Review App Deployment on LinkedIn

## Goal

Explain your three-tier architecture, demonstrate the working application, and share what you learned.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 20 — Published LinkedIn post about your Book Review App deployment on Kubernetes

Add your screenshot here.

### LinkedIn Post URL

Add your published LinkedIn post URL here.
