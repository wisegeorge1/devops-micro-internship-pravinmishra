# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker networking by using default bridge, custom bridge, multiple bridge, and host network modes. You will verify container communication, service discovery, network isolation, public access, and host networking on a Linux VM or EC2 instance.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application Using the Default Bridge Network

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx web server using Docker’s default bridge network and access it through the VM public IP address.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Available Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include the default `bridge`, `host`, and `none` networks.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Nginx Image Pull

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker pull nginx:alpine
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Running `myweb` Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `myweb` container with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Nginx Welcome Page

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Connect Containers Using a Custom Bridge Network

## Goal

Create a custom bridge network and verify that containers can communicate using container names rather than IP addresses.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Custom Bridge Network Created

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `mynetwork` in:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Running `web` and `client` Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show both `web` and `client` containers running without published host ports.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Service Discovery by Container Name

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec client wget -qO- http://web
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Custom Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect mynetwork
```

The output must show both `web` and `client` connected to `mynetwork`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Demonstrate Multi-Network Isolation

## Goal

Deploy frontend, backend, and database containers across two separate Docker networks. Verify allowed communication and confirm that the frontend cannot directly reach the database.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Two Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include both `frontend-network` and `backend-network`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Running Multi-Network Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show:

- `frontend` with the published port mapping `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp`
- `backend` without a published host port
- `db` without a published host port

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Frontend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect frontend-network
```

The output must show `frontend` and `backend`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect backend-network
```

The output must show `backend` and `db`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Frontend-to-Backend Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec frontend wget -qO- http://backend
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Backend-to-Database Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful connection to `db` on port `27017` from the `backend` container.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend-to-Database Isolation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the `frontend` container cannot reach `db` on port `27017`.

The output must include:

```text
Expected result: frontend cannot reach db
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Public Frontend Access

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page from the `frontend` container at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Deploy an Application Using Docker Host Network Mode

## Goal

Run an Nginx container using Docker host network mode and compare it with bridge networking.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 17 — Running Host-Networked Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `fastapp` container.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Host Network Mode Verification

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing output from:

```bash
docker inspect fastapp | grep '"NetworkMode"'
```

The output must confirm:

```text
"NetworkMode": "host"
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 19 — Host-Networked Nginx Page

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Host-Networked Container Cleanup

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker stop fastapp
docker rm fastapp
```

Add your screenshot here.

# Networking Notes

Write a short note explaining:

- Default bridge networking
- Container-name communication on a custom bridge network
- Why the frontend could not access the database in Task 3
- The difference between bridge mode and host network mode

Write your note here.
