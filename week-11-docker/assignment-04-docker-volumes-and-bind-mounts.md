# Assignment 4 — Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Docker Bind Mounts and Docker Volumes to persist logs and application data outside a container’s lifecycle. You will verify that data remains available after containers are removed and recreated.

---

# Task 1 — Persist Nginx Logs Using a Bind Mount

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx container with a Bind Mount and verify that its log files remain on the VM host after the container is removed.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Nginx Image Pull

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker pull nginx:alpine
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Host Log Directory

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the created host directory:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Running Nginx Container with Port Mapping

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the `myweb` container with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Nginx Welcome Page

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Bind-Mounted Log Files

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the host log files and access-log content from:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

The output must show `access.log`, `error.log`, and an access-log entry created when you opened the Nginx page.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Nginx Container Removed

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker stop myweb
docker rm myweb
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Logs Persist After Container Removal

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that `access.log` and `error.log` still exist in:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

The access log must retain its content after the container has been removed.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Share Persistent Data Using a Docker Volume

## Goal

Deploy backend and frontend containers that share data through a named Docker Volume. Verify that the data remains after both containers are removed and recreated.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Project File Structure

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the `two-tier-app` project structure, including separate `backend` and `frontend` directories with a `Dockerfile` and `index.js` file in each.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Custom Docker Network

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `mynetwork` in:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Docker Volume

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `shared-data` in:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend Dockerfile

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the completed backend `Dockerfile`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Image Build

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of the `backend-app:latest` image build.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Running Backend Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `backend` container.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Frontend Dockerfile

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the completed frontend `Dockerfile`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend Image Build

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of the `frontend-app:latest` image build.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Running Backend and Frontend Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show both `backend` and `frontend` containers running. Only `frontend` must have the published port mapping:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Backend Write Operation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful backend write operation to the shared Docker Volume.

The output must include:

```text
Data written: Hello from Backend!
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Frontend Reads Shared Data

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Hello from Backend!
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 19 — First Shared-Data Update

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 1
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Second Shared-Data Update

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 2 - New Update
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 21 — Container Removal and Recreation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the `frontend` and `backend` containers removed and recreated using the same `shared-data` Docker Volume.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 22 — Data Persists After Recreation

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 2 - New Update
```

This proves that the `shared-data` Docker Volume outlived both application containers.

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

Add your screenshot here.

# Storage Persistence Notes

Write a short explanation covering:

- The difference between a Bind Mount and a Docker Volume
- How Task 1 proved Bind Mount persistence
- How Task 2 proved Docker Volume persistence
- Why Docker Volumes are commonly used for application data

Write your explanation here.

---

# Public Application URL

**Application URL:** `Add your VM public IP URL here`

---

# LinkedIn Requirement
