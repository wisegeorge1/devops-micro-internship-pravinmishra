# Assignment 8 — AI-Assisted Docker Container Hardening Audit

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that audits a running Docker container for common hardening gaps — running as root, missing health checks, unpinned image tags, privileged mode, and unnecessary exposed ports — then connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/docker-audit` skill. You will run the audit against your production-grade EpicBook stack, fix what it finds by editing the Dockerfile yourself, rebuild the image, and re-run the audit to prove the fix worked. Claude analyzes evidence and recommends a fix; it never edits your Dockerfile or rebuilds the image itself.

# Target Container

**Target Container Name:** `Add the exact container name here`

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Audit Workspace

## Goal

Create an audit workspace and confirm that the supplied files are available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Audit Workspace Files

Add a terminal screenshot showing your full name and both supplied files:

```text
docker-audit.sh
SKILL.md
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Add the Docker Audit Skill to Claude Code

## Goal

Add the supplied `docker-audit` skill to Claude Code and confirm that it is available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Docker Audit Skill Available in Claude Code

Add a screenshot of Claude Code showing `docker-audit` in the available skill list.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Validate the Audit Script

## Goal

Verify the audit script line endings, Bash syntax, and usage message.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Script Validation

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

- LF line-ending check
- Successful `bash -n docker-audit.sh` validation
- Your full name
- The usage message displayed when the script runs without a container name

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Run the Initial Docker Security Audit

## Goal

Audit a running container and record the initial findings.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Selected Target Container

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

- Your full name
- `docker ps`
- The audit command using the selected target container name

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Initial Audit Results

Add a terminal screenshot showing the initial Docker audit results.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Use AI Assistance to Understand the Findings

## Goal

Use the supplied `docker-audit` skill to understand the initial audit results safely.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Audit Explanation and Recommended Fix

Add a Claude Code screenshot showing:

- Audit finding
- Security risk
- Recommended manual fix
- Verification method

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Apply One Container-Hardening Fix

## Goal

Manually fix one WARN or FAIL finding from the initial audit.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Hardening Configuration Change

Add a screenshot of the updated Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml` showing the selected hardening fix.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Updated Service Running

Add a terminal screenshot showing your full name and the rebuilt or recreated service/container running successfully.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Re-Run the Audit and Compare Results

## Goal

Verify that the selected hardening fix improved the container configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Final Audit Results

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

- Your full name
- The updated running container
- The final audit report

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Before-and-After Comparison

Write a short comparison covering:

- Initial audit finding
- Dockerfile or Docker Compose change applied
- Final audit result
- Security benefit of the improvement

Write your comparison here.

---

# LinkedIn Requirement

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post about the container security checks you performed, one hardening improvement you applied, and why the improvement matters.

### Evidence

**LinkedIn Post URL:** `Add your LinkedIn post URL here`

#### LinkedIn Post Screenshot

Add a screenshot of the published LinkedIn post, including the final audit result.

Add your screenshot here.
