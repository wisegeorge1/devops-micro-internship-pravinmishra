# Assignment 2 — Multi-Stage Docker Build for a React Application

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build both a single-stage and an optimized multi-stage Docker image for a React application, compare the resulting image sizes, and deploy the optimized version using a production-ready Nginx runtime container.

Complete this assignment locally on your own computer where Docker is installed and running.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Project

## Goal

Prepare the React application for Docker image creation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Contents of the `.dockerignore` File

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
cat .dockerignore
```

The file must exclude `node_modules`, `build`, and `.env`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create a Single-Stage Docker Image

## Goal

Create a baseline single-stage Docker image and run the application on port 3000.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Contents of `Dockerfile.single`

Add a screenshot showing the completed `Dockerfile.single`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Single-Stage Application in Browser

Add a screenshot of the browser showing the application at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Ensure that your full name is visible in the application.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create a Multi-Stage Docker Build

## Goal

Create an optimized multi-stage Docker image with separate builder and Nginx runtime stages, then run the application on port 80.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Contents of the Multi-Stage Dockerfile

Add a screenshot showing the completed multi-stage `Dockerfile`.

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Multi-Stage Application in Browser

Add a screenshot of the browser showing the application at:

```text
http://localhost
```

Ensure that your full name is visible in the application.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Compare Docker Image Sizes

## Goal

Compare the single-stage and multi-stage image sizes and calculate the percentage reduction.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Docker Image Size Comparison

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker images
```

The output must include both:

```text
react-single:latest
react-multistage:latest
```

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Percentage Reduction Calculation

Record the image sizes and calculate the reduction using the same unit for both images.

```text
Single-stage image size: Add size here

Multi-stage image size: Add size here

Percentage reduction =
((Single-stage image size − Multi-stage image size)
÷ Single-stage image size) × 100

Percentage reduction: Add result here
```

---

# Task 5 — Analyze the Optimization Results

## Goal

Evaluate the advantages of using multi-stage Docker builds.

### Notes

Write a short analysis of 5–8 lines covering:

- The single-stage and multi-stage image sizes
- The percentage reduction in image size
- Security benefits of the smaller runtime image
- How a smaller runtime image reduces the attack surface
- How smaller images improve image pull and deployment speed
- One Docker build-caching optimization you used

Write your analysis here.

---

# Task 6 — Explore Additional Production Optimizations (Optional)

## Goal

Explore one or more additional production optimization techniques.

### Optional Work

You may choose to:

- Configure an Nginx health check
- Configure cache headers for static assets
- Experiment with a lighter runtime image
- Compare the resulting image size with your original multi-stage image

Screenshots are optional.

---

# LinkedIn Requirement

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post describing what you built, what a multi-stage Docker build is, the image-size reduction achieved, and key learnings from the assignment.

### Evidence

#### LinkedIn Post URL

Paste your LinkedIn post URL here:

`Add your URL here`

---

#### LinkedIn Post Screenshot

Add a screenshot of the published LinkedIn post here.

---
