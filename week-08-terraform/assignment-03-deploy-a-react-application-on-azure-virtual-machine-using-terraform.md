# Assignment 3 — Deploy a React Application on Azure Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision the required Azure infrastructure and automatically deploy the `my-react-app` React application on an Azure Linux virtual machine using a `cloud-init.sh` deployment script passed to the VM through `custom_data`.

You will verify the automated deployment through SSH, confirm that Nginx is running, access the React application through the VM public IP, and destroy the Terraform-managed resources after testing.

---

# Task 0 — Set Up and Verify the Terraform and Azure CLI Environment

## Goal

Prepare your local environment for Terraform deployment by installing Terraform, Azure CLI, and the HashiCorp Terraform extension in VS Code, signing in to your Azure account, and confirming that all required tools are working correctly.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Terraform Version

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful `terraform version` output.

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Screenshot 2 — Azure CLI Version

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful `az version` output.

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Screenshot 3 — HashiCorp Terraform Extension

Add a screenshot of the VS Code Extensions panel showing the HashiCorp Terraform extension installed and enabled.

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project and Define the Infrastructure

## Goal

Create a new Terraform project and define the complete Azure infrastructure required to host the React application using the official Terraform Registry documentation.

The `terraform-react-azure` project must contain:

```text
terraform-react-azure/
├── main.tf
└── cloud-init.sh
```

The Terraform configuration must include:

- Terraform and AzureRM provider configuration
- Resource group
- Virtual network and subnet
- Network Security Group
- SSH rule for TCP port `22`
- HTTP rule for TCP port `80`
- Public IP address
- Network interface
- Linux virtual machine
- `custom_data` configuration referencing `cloud-init.sh`
- Public IP output

The `cloud-init.sh` file must contain the complete automated React application deployment workflow based on the repository instructions.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Provider, Resource Group, and Network Security Group

Add a screenshot of VS Code showing the AzureRM provider, resource group, and Network Security Group configuration in `main.tf`.

---

### Screenshot 11 — VM Public IP Output

Add a screenshot showing the VM public IP address returned by `terraform output`.

Add your screenshot here.

## VM Public IP Address

Record the public IP address displayed by `terraform output`.

**VM Public IP Address:** Add the VM public IP address here

# Task 4 — Verify the Automated Deployment

## Goal

Connect to the Azure Linux virtual machine and confirm that the cloud-init/user data deployment script completed successfully.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 12 — SSH Connection and Completed React Deployment

Add a screenshot of the SSH terminal showing a successful connection to the Azure VM and evidence that the React application deployment completed.

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Screenshot 13 — Nginx Service Status

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the Nginx service is running successfully.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Verify the React Application Deployment

## Goal

Confirm that the automatically deployed React application is publicly accessible and functioning correctly.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 14 — React Application in the Browser

Add a screenshot of the browser showing the deployed React application successfully loaded using the Azure VM public IP.

Ensure that the Azure VM public IP is visible in the browser address bar.

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Destroy the Resources

## Goal

Remove all Azure resources created by Terraform after completing the application deployment and verification.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 15 — Terraform Destroy
