# Assignment 4 — Deploy EpicBook Web App on AWS Using Terraform Modules and Amazon RDS for MySQL

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use reusable Terraform modules to provision the AWS infrastructure required by EpicBook. You will create a custom VPC, one public subnet, two private database subnets across different Availability Zones, an Internet Gateway, a public route table, Security Groups, an EC2 Linux instance, and a private Amazon RDS for MySQL database.

You will use EC2 `user_data` to install the required software, initialize the EpicBook database, connect the application to Amazon RDS, configure Nginx, validate the complete browser-to-database workflow, destroy the resources after testing, and publish the required LinkedIn post.
